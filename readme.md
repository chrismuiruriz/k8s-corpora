# Corpora REST (read only) service
## Taken from ~~https://github.com/dariusk/corpora~~  https://github.com/BryanDollery/corpora

This repo contains a deployable version of Dariusk's Corpora collection. I have included an nginx based dockerfile that serves the json files without extenstion, and an index.html file to document the available collections.

This image has been created as part of the KnowledgeHut DevOps Bootcamp that I'm designing and running in the Middle East.
